If you are a 3D artist who works with character animation, you know how important it is to have a good skinning system that allows you to create realistic and smooth deformations. Skinning is the process of attaching a 3D mesh to a skeleton of bones that control its movement. However, skinning can be challenging and time-consuming, especially when dealing with complex models and poses.
