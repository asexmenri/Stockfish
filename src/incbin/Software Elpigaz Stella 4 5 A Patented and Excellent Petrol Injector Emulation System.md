# How to Install and Use Software Elpigaz Stella 4 5 for LPG Cars
 
Software Elpigaz Stella 4 5 is a program that allows you to configure and monitor the performance of your LPG car system. LPG stands for liquefied petroleum gas, which is a clean and economical alternative fuel for vehicles. LPG cars use a special device called a gas injection system, which injects LPG into the engine instead of petrol.
