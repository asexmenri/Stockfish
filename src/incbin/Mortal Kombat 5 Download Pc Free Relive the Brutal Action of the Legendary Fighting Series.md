Now that you know how to download Mortal Kombat 5 for free on your PC, you might be wondering how to play it. Mortal Kombat 5 is not a game for the faint of heart. It requires skill, strategy, and timing to master its complex and brutal combat system. Here are some tips to help you get started:
 
## 1. Make use of quick combo references
 
Getting used to the fast-paced mechanics takes time, and you'll often feel pressured to rely on the basics - simple kicks, punches, and grabs. You'll have a much better chance of winning if you learn some of the combos that each character can perform. Combos are sequences of button presses that unleash powerful attacks that can deal more damage, stun your opponent, or even trigger a fatality. You can view a list of combos for each character by opening the menu while you have them selected. You can also practice them in the training mode before jumping into a real fight.[^3^]
 
## 2. Know how to block and evade
 
Blocking is essential in Mortal Kombat 5, as it can reduce or negate the damage you receive from your opponent's attacks. To block, you need to hold two fingers on the screen. However, blocking is not foolproof. Some attacks can break through your guard, such as low kicks, overhead strikes, or throws. To avoid these attacks, you need to evade them by jumping over them, crouching under them, or moving away from them. You can also use evasive moves to create openings for your own attacks.[^1^]
 
## 3. Know how to punish your opponent
 
Punishing is the act of retaliating to a sloppy, poorly timed, or blocked attack with an attack of your own. This is a crucial skill in Mortal Kombat 5, as it can turn the tide of a fight in your favor. To punish your opponent effectively, you need to know their frame data. Frame data determines how long attacks take to start, how long attacks take to become available again after being executed, and how long a fighter is vulnerable after having an attack blocked. The negative block valueâwhich is the amount of time an opponent needs to recover after having an attack blockedâmust be longer than your combo's startup frame time.[^1^]
